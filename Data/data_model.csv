Why don't you slip into something more comfortable...like a coma. 

Wipe your mouth. There's still a tiny bit of bull** around your lips. 

Shhhh...that's the sound of nobody caring what you think. 

If you have something to say, raise your hand and place it over your mouth. 

You're not yourself today. I noticed the improvement right away. 

I heard you changed your mind. What did you do with the diaper? 

If you're not into oral sex, keep your mouth shut. 

Are you from Memphis, 'cause you're the only ten I see. 

I may not be Mr. Right, but I'll do ya until he shows up. 

Did you have an extra bowl of stupid this morning? 

I'm happier than Michael Jackson at a Harry Potter book signing. 

We had a black out the other night...but the police made him get back in his car 

You know what I hate? Indian givers...no wait, I take that back. 

We Capricorns don't believe in horoscopes. 

35% of all statistics are made up. 

Honesty is the key to a relationship. If you can fake that, you're in. 

Alcohol doesn't solve any problems, but then again, neither does milk. 

Excuses are like asses.... everyone's got em and they all stink. 

The question isn't who is going to let me; it's who is going to stop me? 

If you can't be a good example, then you'll just have to be a horrible warning. 

No one dies a virgin, life screws us all. 

We have enough gun control. What we need is idiot control. 

If ignorance is bliss, you must be overjoyed. 

Does the career advice, &quot;Come early on your first day&quot; apply in the porn business? 

If you get them by the balls, their hearts and minds will follow. 

If you have trouble getting your children's attention, just sit down and look comfortable. 

You know it's time to do the laundry when you dry off with a sneaker. 

What do you call 88 rednecks in an orgy? A family reunion. 

A teacher is a person who used to think he liked children. 

A woman never forgets the men she could have had; a man, the women he couldn't. 

Marriage is a relationship in which one person is always right and the other is a husband! 

Behind every successful man is a surprised woman. 

I hate sex in the movies. Tried it once. The seat folded up, the drink spilled... 

Wish in one hand and **** in the other and see which one gets full first. 

Good sex can correct poor posture...or at least make it stand up straight. 

I have amnesia and deja vu at the same time. I think I've forgotten this before. 

Don't let aging get you down...It's too hard to get back up! 

If at first you don't succeed... you're doing about average. 

My new health club is so fancy, they have a spiral StairMaster. 

Women who seek to be equal to men, lack ambition. 

The future is that time when you'll wish you'd done what you aren't doing now. 

When the toilet paper of experience is depleted, the *** of reason goes unwiped. 

Nobody's ugly after 2 a.m. 

God made man before woman to give him time to think of an answer for her first question. 

Sex burns up 350 calories each time. Please help me, I'm on a diet. 

Don't worry about what people think, they don't do it very often. 

Rented cars are the only true &quot;all terrain vehicle&quot;. 

If money doesn't grow on trees then why do banks have branches? 

The hardest thing to learn in life is which bridge to cross and which to burn. 

What matters is not the length of the wand, but the magic in the stick. 

The secret to getting rid of unwanted pubic hair is to spit. 

Any woman can have the body of a 21-year-old, as long as she buys him a few drinks first. 

These days about half the stuff in my shopping cart says, &quot;For fast relief.&quot; 

It is better to light just one candle...than to clean the whole apartment. 

Not only did my ex-wife drive me crazy, she made me pay for the gas. 

Some women are terribly hard to please...the rest are impossible! 

At the mall I saw a kid on a leash. I think if I ever have a kid, it's gonna be cordless. 

The roundest knight at King Arthur's table was Sir Cumference. 

They say it is better to give than to receive. I say it depends on the gift. 

My wife is so skinny, she can tread water in a garden hose. 

I was a bank teller. That was a great job. I was bringing home $450,000 a week. 

Legalize maru...mawa...moua...mawo...ummm...Pot. 

They say that hard work never killed anybody, but did you ever know anyone who rested to death? 

My girlfriend is so stupid, she thought an innuendo was an Italian suppository! 

My mail is a little slow. Last month my flower seeds came as a bouquet. 

If I ever had twins, I'd use one for parts. 

It is impossible to enjoy idling thoroughly unless one has plenty of work to do. 

A bachelor is a selfish, undeserving guy who has cheated some woman out of a divorce. 

Remember &quot;I&quot; before &quot;E&quot;, except in Budweiser. 

Men are like roses. Watch out for the pricks. 

Practice makes perfect...but if nobody's perfect, why practice? 

Do you ever get the feeling that your stuff has strutted without you? 

Bachelors know more about women than married men, that's why they not married. 

I put a dollar in a change machine. Nothing changed. 

God created man before woman... but there is always a rough draft before the masterpiece.

I am trained in the Old Testament and I’m the top converter in the entire church mission group. You are nothing to me but just another heathen. I will cast your sins out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before in Heaven, mark my diddily-iddilly words. You think you can get away with saying that blasphemy to me over the Internet? Think again, friendarino. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of evangelists across Springfield and your IP is being traced by God right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggorino. The storm that wipes out the diddily little thing you call your life of sin. You’re going to Church, kiddily-widdily. Jesus can be anywhere, anytime, and he can turn you to the Gospel in over infinity ways, and that’s just with his bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in preaching to nonbelievers, but I have access to the entire dang- diddily Bible collection of the Springfield Bible College and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your sins away off the face of the continent, you diddily-doo satan-worshipper. If only you could have known what holy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you from the Heavens, maybe you would have held your darn-diddily-fundgearoo tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re clean of all your sins, you widdillo-skiddily neighborino. I will sing hymns of praise all over you and you will drown in the love of Christ. You’re farn-foodily- flank-fiddily reborn, kiddo-diddily.

Jesus can be anywhere, anytime, and he can turn you to the Gospel in over infinity ways, and that’s just with his bare hands.

You know the routine. So now, I pretty much just ignore it. Every now and then I will point out that if I were teaching elementary school I might need to say, &quot;Ok now, pick up your head.&quot; But again, these are high school students, not babies. So I usually just let it go.
 Case in point, I had a student transfer into my Financial Algebra class last week. When he introduced himself to me he was quiet, and he told me he had been taking class at the &quot;Boy's Ranch&quot;. If you are not familiar with that, it is a group home for young men who, for some reason or another, are no longer able to live with their parents. They have been in trouble with the law, refuse to follow parents rules and become a ward of the court, or some have parents with drug problems who can’t take care of their children. He was fine the first week, but this week on Tuesday, he came into class (2nd period) and shortly put his head down. We are doing our unit on filing Federal Taxes and that day we were doing a return that involved married couple with children who itemize their taxes and get tax credits. All by hand, the old fashioned way. I just assumed he had lost interest, so I let him sleep. The bell rang and I didn't let anyone wake him. My next class came in and I made the stay away from him and let him sleep. About 10 minutes into 3rd period as I was at the board going over the day’s lesson in Algebra 1, the young man woke up. He looked around, trying to figure out where he was. He gathered his things and quietly left. Fortunately, he did not ask me for a note. The next day when he came to class he approached me and I immediately spoke first. I told him that I let him sleep as I was concerned for his well-being. If you needed to sleep that badly, I wanted to let you get what you needed. (Is that sarcasm?) 
He started by apologizing for sleeping in class, and then then told me this story. He said his real mother who he had not spoken with 10 years had recently contacted him. He then said she had called him again the night before at about 10:30 and they talked for a long while. He then stayed awake thinking about their conversation and about his feelings. That’s why he was so tired.
If I had woke him up during class, he would not have shared that with me. If I had written him up for sleeping in class, he would probably have been mad and not shared what was going on. He has been back on track since then.
For the ones who are multiple offenders, I started keeping a file.

Study Experts award Karma Points to students for helping other students and starting new discussions about Algebra on the Algebra Wall. You can help students by telling them which videos will help them with their questions and by explaining how to start problems. You won't be given Karma Points if you just give the answer. You’ll be awarded 100, 200 or 500 Karma Points, depending on your post. You can also see where you stand with other students by looking at the Karma Points Leaderboard. The number of Karma Points you’ve earned is shown on each wall post that you make, on the header above the video player, and on the My Account page. Why do you want to earn Karma Points? Because you can win great prizes! Check out algebranation.com/karmapoints for more info.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,4294967295,0,4/6/2015 22:19,4/6/2015 22:19,marginal

Is there a teacher resource that has the answers to the test yourself challenges at the end of each section?

I don't think we have that available, but send an email to help@algebranation.com to see if maybe someone can provide you a copy of the answers.

With a lean and a pocket full of green
The green doesn't symbolize I made it on the top
But Robocop last year was a shock
The tone of the Popeye cut shook your butt
Kids are screaming; the media says, &quot;What...
Kind of music is this for you to dance to?&quot;
The man with the plan and the man demands you
Leave the smack and the crack for the wack
Throw the vial in the Nile; keep a smile like that
Leave the knife and the gun in the store
And ignore temptation, sent by the nation
Racial gain causes pain; need a new rep
In your hearts and minds never forget Yusef
Hawkins
And you're walking
You don't just run
Black on black; remember that; it's important
Any way the struggle is won brings forth the fun
No hatred; the summer's almost done
No time for sleep
Jump in your Jeep
And pump up the funky beat a whole week
Beeper goes off yo smash it and trash it
You're too young to be plumped in a casket
Just get your boys and bring the noise
And just swing it
And party people, sing it

Chorus:
Treat me right
I'll treat you good

Kids in the crib want dibs on the big man
&quot;Can he come out? Can he come out and slam a jam?
&quot;I'm his number one fan, yes I am&quot;
All these kids realize that I'm the man
Six foot three and maybe a quarter of an inch bigger
Than last year, but still a unique figure
Rob Swinger, Doc No, Dinky, and Hot Dog know
That I'm a man who was born to have a mic on
Next to me at all time; ready to kick a rhyme
That will keep me out of financial bind
That's why when it comes to fans I'm never mean
Kids on St. James between Gates and Greene
Always say hello, cause I'm a modest fellow
Never try to play a super star that's hollow
Cause if these kids don't go buy our records
We'll be has-beens - and plus naked
So we owe them, so pull out your pen
Sign an autograph; you might make a new friend
So just get your boys and bring the noise and just swing it
And party people in the house, sing it

Chorus

Party people in the house, listen up
I'm the man with the plan and the band rips it up
Peace to Howie Tee, good lookin', gee
Swinger, Hot Dog, Doc No, Bud, Ed Lover, Dinky
Fish and chips with the hippy hippy hips
Before the tune ends, give me some lips (ah!)
Sanity Crystal, my niece
And Lady Kazam, my homegirl, peace
And leave the guns and have fun; out!
And oh yeah, sing it

Chorus

Break

Well coming back
To nineteen ninety
Chubb Rock jumps up on the scene with a lean and a hardcore dream
The dream wasn't crafted to be pornographic
Decency started from the crib, plus kids
Don't need to hear all of that on the rap
The strength of my vibe placed Chubbs on the map
Cause authority, seniority goes far
My staff gives autographs plus gives nuff laughs
Read my mic, heed my sight, I'll definitely lead you right
Just treat me right
Peace

I must admit though, using a graphing calculator when I took Pre-calculus really helped me to make the connections. I believe students need to make the connections.

So I tell them even if I am ok with cell phones we will not use them because it is a rule.

After that, you need to distribute the slope(4) and by doing that you get y - 1 = 4x - 8. Lastly, you need to solve for y, so to get y by itself, you need to add 1 to both sides.

Let y = the total cost for the bus with its passengers to use the ferry.

Then, when there are 30 people on the bus (x = 30), the cost was $180 (y = 180). This means the point (x, y) = (30, 180).
Also, when there were 50 people on the bus, the cost was $220. So that is the point (50, 220).

You see we have two points and so we can write the equation of a line that goes through those points. The first thing we have to do is find the slope.

The slope of the line joining two points is the rise divided by the run. That means

m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

Study Experts (graduate students and teachers who work for Algebra Nation to moderate) award Karma Points to students for helping other students and starting new discussions about math on the Wall. Students can help other students by directing them to videos that will help them with their questions and by explaining the first step of how to start a particular math problems. But remember, students won't be given Karma Points if they just give the answer to the question another student's question!

Students can also see where they stand by looking at the Karma Points Leaderboard. The number of Karma Points that the students has earned is shown on each wall post they make, on the top of the screen, and on the Leaderboard page.

What do students want to earn Karma Points? The best way to learn math is to help others. Also, in addition to bragging rights, students can win great prizes! Recently, students have won t-shirts, pizza parties, and iPads!

Florida Algebra 1 students! Here is what you can win:

From September to April each year, we give out 2 iPads each month, 1 to the middle school student and 1 to the high school student who earn the most Karma Points that month. Each month, first place wins an iPad. Second, third, forth, fifth, and sixth places each win a Math Nation t-shirt.

Please note that while students can win a t-shirt more than 1 time (we have multiple colors now!), students can only win an iPad once.",0,,,1,0,0,0,,,,4294967295,0,12/19/2016 0:26,12/19/2016 0:26,safe

There is not currently a compiled list of all our Beat The Test questions, but that sounds like an excellent EOC Prep-resource! I'm adding it to a discussion with my teammates. 

In the mean time, here is what I use for EOC-Prep Questions compiled in one place:
1. In the Teacher Area, Algebra 1 Resources - find the folder labeled &quot;Boot Camp&quot;. These can be printed in Word or PDF. There are even videos for EACH question at the bottom of the Student Area.
2. EdgeXL - Create an assessment at ANY length pulling from a huge back of EOC-style questions. These assessments can be delivered digitally or printed. I like to assign these digitally, choose to iterate the questions, show students feedback, and then offer unlimited attempts... now you have an infinite self-generating review sheet!

Would you like a class set of Algebra 1 workbooks to finish this EOC Prep-season strong? They're purchased for you already by the State Department of Education and can be in Greer for school next week!",0,,,0,0,0,0,,,,4294967295,0,5/12/2021 14:16,5/12/2021 14:16,safe

30,000(.7)ˣ 
what is the number of bacteria after 2 hours? is the function increasing or decreasing? what do the parts of the equation mean?
------------------------------------------
- the value after 2 hours can be represented with 30,000(.7)² = 30,000(.49)= 14,700
-the function is decreasing since b, the growth or decay rate, is a decimal, which means that with every number of x, the value of it decreases
-well, a is the initial value, and the a here is 30,000, so that means the starting number of bacteria was 30,000
- b is the decay rate since it is less than one, so the .7 means that after every hour the size of the colony is only 70 percent of what it used to be. This also means it is decreasing by 30%
-x is the number of hours since the colony started

(A) * n = 4 + (n + 1)(-5)

Multiply A * n
nA = 4 + (n + 1)(-5)

Reorder the terms:
nA = 4 + (1 + n)(-5)

Reorder the terms for easier multiplication:
nA = 4 + -5(1 + n)
nA = 4 + (1 * -5 + n * -5)
nA = 4 + (-5 + -5n)

Combine like terms: 4 + -5 = -1
nA = -1 + -5n

Solving
nA = -1 + -5n

Solving for variable 'n'.

Move all terms containing n to the left, all other terms to the right.

Add '5n' to each side of the equation.
5n + nA = -1 + -5n + 5n

Combine like terms: -5n + 5n = 0
5n + nA = -1 + 0
5n + nA = -1

 Nice! Last night I was going over Sections 2 and 3 and by going over the videos , I have some summaries of myself.

Section 2 Video 1 Part 3 (Since I had trouble of this yesterday) - When looking for a domain of a function , you have to first determine is the parabola opens upwards or downwards.If Upwards , then Domain should be all possible numbers of 'x' and Range should be 'y' greater tan the value at the vertex. Same thing if open Downwards except that Range should be 'y' less than  the value of the vertex. So It all depends if the Parabola is open up , down , left , or right. We have to carefully look at the equation and test some numbers before we come with our solution.

 Section 3 Video 2 - Multiply across to solve simple fraction equations and don't forget to always Simplify at the end. Now when it comes to divisions , use the first fraction and multiply by the second fraction's Reciprocal ( Like 3/4's reciprocal is 4/3).

Section 3 Video 3 - treat these decimal equations like any other regular equation by getting 'x' by itself. See whats happening to 'x' and do the opposite of it. Now to ease the decimals , you can move the decimal to the right as long as you do that to every single number of that equation

Let's look at the exponent expansion again...
We could have easily converted it into this
2^16*3^7*5^3*7
Looking at the 7, we know it's prime so we can eliminate that completely because it doesn't matter.
Now, moving on the rest of the expansion, we notice that the perfect squares all have natural, even exponents... We can use this to our benefit by converting the above expansion to an expansion of all the perfect square factors:
2^8*3^3*5^1...
Now, there's a formula to find the number of divisors when given a perfect square factorization... It's actually quite simple. Add 1 to all of the eponents and multiply them together...
So thus, we have 9*4*2=72...
That's the same answer as what was in the answer key...
I guess we could have done it using casework, but this solution is way more concise, organized, elegant, and harder to make a mistake in...",0,,,1,0,0,0,,,,4294967295,0,7/31/2019 18:12,7/31/2019 18:12,safe

1) All if the x's MUST be different
2) The vertical line test
***The VLT is when you draw many vertical lines anywhere on the graph.
If the lines touch the graph more than once, it is a relation.
If it touches ONLY once, it is a function
